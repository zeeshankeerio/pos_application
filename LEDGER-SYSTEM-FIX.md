# Ledger System Fix Documentation

This document explains the fixes applied to the ledger system to resolve data visibility issues and ensure proper integration between the different database schemas.

## Issue Summary

The ledger system was experiencing the following issues:

1. Data was being stored in the database but not appearing in the ledger UI
2. The connection between the main database and ledger database was not properly configured
3. Entries in the main database were missing khata (account book) references

## Applied Fixes

We implemented several fixes to resolve these issues:

### 1. Database Connection Fix

- Added `sslmode=disable` to the connection strings to resolve SSL certificate verification issues
- Fixed port numbers (using 6543 for connection pooling and 5432 for direct connections)
- Updated the environment variables in `.env` file

### 2. Data Synchronization

- Created a script (`fix-ledger-connection.js`) to synchronize data between the ledger database and main database
- Added khata references to all ledger entries to ensure they appear in the UI
- Fixed the bill-to-entry mapping to ensure proper data visibility

### 3. Schema Mapping

- Updated the adapter in `app/lib/ledger-db.ts` to correctly handle khataId filtering
- Ensured khataId is stored in both reference and notes fields for robust filtering
- Fixed the data mapping between different schema models

## Verification

We created verification scripts to confirm the fixes worked:

1. `verify-ledger-system.js` - Checks overall system health
2. `check-ledger-sync.js` - Verifies data synchronization
3. `fix-remaining-entries.js` - Ensures all entries have khata references

All scripts confirmed that the system is now working correctly.

## Maintenance Guidelines

To maintain the ledger system properly, follow these guidelines:

### Adding New Entries

When adding new entries to the ledger system:

1. Always include a khata reference in the following format:
   - In notes field: `khata:{khataId}`
   - In reference field: `khata:{khataId}`

2. Use the ledger API endpoints rather than direct database access to ensure proper data mapping

### Database Management

For database management:

1. Always use the correct connection strings:
   - For regular queries: `postgresql://user:password@hostname:6543/database?pgbouncer=true&schema=ledger&sslmode=disable`
   - For migrations: `postgresql://user:password@hostname:5432/database?schema=ledger&sslmode=disable`

2. When making schema changes:
   - Update both `schema.prisma` and `schema-ledger.prisma`
   - Run migrations for both schemas

### Troubleshooting

If data visibility issues occur again:

1. Run `node check-ledger-sync.js` to check data synchronization
2. Verify that all entries have khata references
3. Check the database connection settings
4. Ensure `useMockDataForTesting` is set to `false` in `app/lib/ledger-db.ts`

## Technical Details

### Key Files

- `app/lib/ledger-db.ts` - Main adapter between schemas
- `prisma/schema-ledger.prisma` - Ledger-specific schema
- `app/api/ledger/route.ts` - Main API endpoint for ledger data
- `app/api/ledger/khata/route.ts` - API endpoint for khata management

### Database Schema

The system uses two database schemas:

1. **Main schema**: Contains the `LedgerEntry` and `LedgerTransaction` tables
2. **Ledger schema**: Contains specialized tables like `Khata`, `Bill`, `Party`, etc.

The adapter in `app/lib/ledger-db.ts` maps between these schemas.

### Khata Reference Format

Khata references are stored in the following format:

- In notes field: `khata:{khataId}`
- In reference field: `khata:{khataId}`

The API uses these references to filter entries by khata.

## Future Improvements

For better stability and performance, consider these improvements:

1. Create a proper database migration to add a `khataId` column to the `LedgerEntry` table
2. Implement a scheduled job to keep the two schemas in sync
3. Add validation to ensure all new entries have khata references
4. Improve error handling in the API endpoints

## Conclusion

The ledger system is now fully functional with all data properly visible in the UI. The fixes ensure proper integration between the different database schemas and provide a robust foundation for future development.
