# Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Inventory POS application to Vercel with Supabase as the database.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account: [https://vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup)
- A GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository with your code
- A Supabase account with a project set up: [https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/)
- A Clerk account for authentication: [https://clerk.com/](https://clerk.com/)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Supabase Database

1. **Get Connection Details**:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Project Settings → Database
   - Copy both connection strings:
     - **Connection Pooling** string for `DATABASE_URL` (with `?pgbouncer=true` at the end)
     - **Direct Connection** string for `DIRECT_URL`

2. **Enable Row Level Security**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Table Editor
   - Make sure Row Level Security (RLS) is properly configured for your tables

## Step 2: Set Up Clerk Authentication

1. **Create a Clerk Application**:
   - Sign in to your Clerk dashboard
   - Create a new application or select an existing one
   - Go to API Keys
   - Copy your publishable key and secret key

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Connect Your Repository**:
   - Log in to Vercel
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
   - Select the repository containing your Inventory POS application

2. **Configure Project**:
   - **Framework Preset**: Select "Next.js"
   - **Build and Output Settings**: Leave as default
   - **Environment Variables**: Add the following environment variables:

     ```
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?pgbouncer=true
     DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-ID].supabase.co:5432/postgres
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[YOUR-PUBLISHABLE-KEY]
     CLERK_SECRET_KEY=[YOUR-SECRET-KEY]
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
     NODE_ENV=production
     ```

3. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the deployment to complete

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Deployment Logs**:
   - In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project
   - Click on the latest deployment
   - Check the build logs for any errors

2. **Test Database Connection**:
   - Visit your deployed application
   - Try to log in and verify that you can access the database
   - Check that all features work correctly

3. **Database Migration**:
   - If needed, you can run database migrations manually from your local machine:
     ```bash
     npx prisma db push
     ```
   - This should be handled automatically by the `vercel-build` script in package.json

## Step 5: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
2. Click on "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain and follow the instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database connection issues:

1. **Check Database URL**:
   - Verify that your connection strings are correct
   - Make sure you're using the pooled connection string for `DATABASE_URL`
   - Make sure you're using the direct connection string for `DIRECT_URL`

2. **IP Allow List**:
   - In Supabase, go to Project Settings → Database
   - In the "Connection Pooling" section, make sure to allow Vercel's IPs
   - You can set it to allow all connections (0.0.0.0/0) for simplicity, but this is less secure

3. **Check Schema**:
   - Make sure your Prisma schema matches your database schema
   - Run `npx prisma db push` from your local machine to update the schema if needed

### Authentication Issues

If authentication isn't working:

1. **Check Clerk Configuration**:
   - Verify that your Clerk API keys are correct
   - Make sure you've added your Vercel deployment URL to the allowed domains in Clerk

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - In Vercel, go to your project settings
   - Click on "Environment Variables"
   - Verify that all Clerk-related variables are set correctly

## Ongoing Maintenance

1. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Use Vercel Analytics to monitor your application performance
   - Set up Sentry or another error tracking solution for detailed error reporting

2. **Database Backups**:
   - Set up regular backups for your Supabase database
   - Supabase provides automatic backups, but you may want to set up additional backup procedures

3. **Updates**:
   - When you push updates to your repository, Vercel will automatically redeploy your application
   - Make sure to test changes locally before pushing to production
